# <a name="overview">Overview</a>

This project's goal is to provide an initial implementation of a possible Augmented Reality (AR) API for the Web on top of iOS ARKit and WKWebView. The initial prorotype is built on top of ARKit available since iOS 11. 

A major objective of this project is to get a conversation going on the subject of how to provide Augmented Reality capabilities to the web: WebAR.

Defining how a web standard will look like is a complex conversation. All the code and proposals in this project are not meant to be the definitive implementatios of AR capabilities for the web, but some prototypes you can play around with at your own risk and have some starting point to build upon.
